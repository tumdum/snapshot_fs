Presumed to be under copyright.




We are not sure Mr. Clottes wants to keep a copyright on these,
or whether he wants to put them in the Public Domain; in either
case, we would prefer not to jeopardize his rights, and we thus
are preparing this release as if it were copyrighted in 1995.

The translation in the original message we received was:
"All rights reserved" so we are presuming the copyright.
"Tous droits reserves" in the original French message...
which is also included in this package and in English.

If you want to get permission to use these for more uses than a
private one, we suggest you contact the Minstry of Culture.

Here is the permission statement we received in both French and
English, and we are VERY glad to have received it on such short
notice, and did not want to disturb things further by asking an
additional time for more details.


Monsieur,

Comme suite votre courrier ilectronique du 7 fivrier dernier, je vous informe
que M. Jean Clottes, conseiller scientifique du sous-directeur de l'archiologie
et auteur des quatre photographies et du texte sur la grotte ricemment
dicouverte en Ardhche, a donni son autorisation pour l'utilisation de ses
photographies dans le cadre du projet de CD-ROM Gutenberg.

Merci de ne pas oublier de mentionner son nom sur les documents publiis.


Sir,

As per your email of February 7th, I informed Mr. Jean Clottes, Scientific
Consul to the Deputy-Director of Archeology and author of the four
photographs and the texts concerning the cave paintings discovered
in Ardhche, to get his authorization for the utilization
of his photographs by the staff of Project Gutenberg's CDROM.

Please do not forget to mention his name in the documents you publish.




Following are the English- and French-language descriptions.




AN EXCEPTIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY

A Paleolithical Embellished Cave found in France (Ardeche)

An exceptional archeological discovery has been made public on
January 17, 1995, by the Minister of Culture and French-Speaking
language (Francophonie), Mr. Jacques TOUBON.

Discovered during December 1994 at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc (Ardeche,
France), the cave, composed of several spacious galleries and
dens, is adorned with some 300 paleolithical paintings and
engravings (dating 18,000 - 20,000 years before present time),
which focus on a wide variety of animals including bears, owls,
mammooths, rhinos and felines.

The cave has also retained several vestiges of human activities:
fireplaces (hearths), entailed flints and other clues which denote an
evolution in tools and habits. Totally left intact and untouched by any
human intrusion throughout the ages, the cave represents and
exceptional source of studies for archeologists.

In the wake of the artistical and archeological interest spawned by
this thrilling discovery of national and international importance, the
Director of Cultural Heritage has signed on January 13th the
proceedings to classify the site. (I don't know if the translation
makes sense: a "classified site" is a site which, due to its cultural
importance, becomes an official patrimony of the nation.) This
urgency measure, taking effect immediately, confers the cave for
one year the same statute and privileges which the historical
monuments benefit.

In order to ensure the preservation and the security of the cave, the
Prefect of Ardeche has also signed on January 13 a by-law
prohibiting the access to the cavity.

Paris, January the 18th, 1995






This is the original message we received in French.




Decouverte d'une grotte
ornee paleolithique a Vallon-Pont-d'Arc
(Ardeche)

Cliches : Ministere de la culture et de la francophonie - Direction du
Patrimoine
Jean Clottes. Tous droits reserves.


Une decouverte archeologique d'une importance exceptionnelle vient
d'intervenir dans les gorges de l'Ardeche, en limite du site naturel
classe, en l'espece d'un vaste reseau souterrain orne d'un tres grand
nombre de peintures et de gravures d'epoque paleolithique (vers
18000-20000 ans avant le present).

La decouverte est intervenue sur le territoire de la commune de
Vallon-Pont-d'Arc, le 25 decembre dernier, dans le cadre d'une
prospection archeologique autorisee au titre des dispositions de la loi
validee du 27 septembre 1941 portant reglementation de la recherche
archeologique de France. Elle est le fait de M. Jean-Marie Chauvet,
agent de surveillance titulaire au sein du Service regional de
l'archeologie (D.R.A.C Rhne-Alpes) assiste de deux benevoles Mme
Eliette Brunel-Deschamps et M. Christian Hillaire.


Au terme d'une desobstruction manuelle conduite dans un boyau tres
etroit marquant le fond d'une cavite mineure s'ouvrant dans les
falaises du Cirque d'Estre, les inventeurs ont debouche par une
cheminee dans un tres vaste reseau totalement vierge, richement
concretionne et recelant de nombreux restes paleontologiques en place
(os d'ours de cavernes- Ursus spelaeus- dans leur bauge d'hibernation).
Les galeries, fortement dimensionnees (section de 5 x 4 metres en
moyenne), joignent plusieurs vastes salles (jusqu'a 70 x 40 metres) et
sont, de place en place, decorees de peintures et de gravures de
figurations animalieres isolees ou organisees en panneaux comprenant
plus de cinquante unites dont les dimensions varient de 0,50 m a 4
metres de long. Au total, environ 300 peintures a l'ocre rouge ou au
noir ont ete actuellement observees et au moins autant de gravures. On
remarque plusieurs cas de superposition, et, localement, des voiles
concretionnes ou des griffades d'ours, l'ensemble de ces faits
authentifiant (s'il en etait besoin) l'anciennete de ces decors.

a chaque extremite du reseau visite on peut constater la presence
d'acces anciens actuellement colmates par des eboulis et des depots
argileux.

L'ensemble des galeries parcourues cumule un lineaire de plusieurs
centaines de metres au long duquel se developpe un bestiaire tres
original et particulierement varie (chevaux, rhinoceros, lions, bisons,
aurochs, ours, pantheres, mammouths, bouquetins, hiboux, etc...)
accompagne de signes symboliques, de panneaux ponctues et de mains
positives ou negatives.

Au plan artistique, il se degage un ensemble absolument unique dans le
Sud de la France, que son importance et son originalite placent au meme
rang que l'ensemble figure de Lascaux meme s'il n'offre pas de
veritable polychromie ni le meme dimensionnement des representations.

Partout, les traits peints ou graves sont plus ou moins concretionnes.
Les traits peints, vus dans leurs details, presentent l'aspect erode
caracteristique des peintures anciennes, meme celles apparemment les
mieux conservees. En outre, la grotte est vierge, avec des sols intacts
et d'innombrables vestiges non touches. Dans une salle, un ensemble de
gravures (cheval, mammouth, hibou) se trouve sur une retombee de voute
a 5 ou 6 m du sol ; au-dessous, un vaste effondrement ancien explique
ce qui s'est passe : une aspiration a provoque la formation de cet
entonnoir et le sol sur lequel se trouvait l'artiste a alors disparu,
de sorte que les gravures sont maintenant inaccessibles. Donc,
l'authenticite est evidente.


La zone a peintures rouges comprend plusieurs panneaux de points,
auxquels s'ajoutent parfois des signes, y compris des signes complexes
originaux. Les panneaux avec des animaux rouges sont divers : dans une
petite galerie, un cerf, est suivi tout au fond, de trois ours des
cavernes et d'un cheval. Ailleurs, un grand panneau comprend plusieurs
ours, dont un a l'avant-train tachete, un felin lui aussi tachete sur
le haut du corps, un bouquetin et deux mammouths. Sur une paroi se
voient un enorme rhinoceros a la corne disproportionnee, trois autres
rhinoceros, un mammouth, deux felins, quatre mains positives et deux ou
trois negatives, un demi-cercles de points rouges, un grand bovine,
un signe fait de deux demi-cercles accoles. En tout, outre les points
et les signes, plusieurs mains negatives completes et les mains
positives, une trentaine de representations animales rouges et deux
petites tetes de chevaux jaunes ont deja ete denombres. L'ours domine
suivi du mammouth, du cheval, du rhinoceros, du felin ; le cerf, le
bouquetin, l'aurochs, les indetermines, n'etant representes qu'a un
seul exemplaire chacun.



Une centaine de figures noires a ete denombree : les rhinoceros
dominent largement, suivis des felins puis des chevaux, les ours, des
rennes, des bisons, des aurochs. On note la presence de mammouths, de
cerfs megaceros, d'un bouquetin, de deux indetermines. Parmi les
gravures, a noter 5 mammouths, 3 bouquetins, 2 rhinoceros, 2 chevaux, 1
aurochs, 1 hibou.

La facture de ces representations est excellente. Les proportions des
corps sont naturalistes. Il s'agit surtout de dessins au trait, encore
que certains presentent des a-plats de peinture a l'interieur des tetes
ou des corps et un rendu savant du modele. De nombreux details
anatomiques sont precises, de sorte que les animaux sont le plus
souvent determinables sans ambiguite quant a l'espece et meme quant au
sexe (femelles bisons, par exemple). Les dessins noirs ont "un air de
famille" : la composition des panneaux, la facture des animaux, la
technique employee partout avec une egale maitrise feraient penser a
une meme "main". On peut legitimement se demander s'il ne s'agirait
pas, en tres grande partie, de l'oeuvre d'une seule personne, un
grand maitre du trait. Les recherches futures le preciseront.

Par le nombre et la diversite des oeuvres, par leur qualite esthetique
et leur conservation, par leur originalite aussi (dominance d'especes
rares ailleurs), par la preservation du contexte, cette grotte est
unique et d'une importance mondiale. C'est l'un des plus grand chefs
d'oeuvres de l'art prehistorique.

Au plan paleontologique, la cavite recele egalement les restes d'une
centaine d'ursides, soit en place dans leur loge d'hibernation, soit en
position secondaire, que les os aient ete deplaces par le passage de
l'Homme, ou que certains cranes aient ete redisposes par lui en des
emplacements privilegies de la grotte (par exemple au centre d'une
salle en rotonde, sur un bloc rocheux).

Cette abondance de restes dans un milieu preserve de toute perturbation
moderne confere un second caractere d'importance a la decouverte.

Au plan archeologique, il convient de souligner le caractere unique
d'un milieu clos exempt de toute intrusion et de tout remaniement.
Outre les figurations, l'Homme a laisse dans la cavite de nombreux
temoins de ses activites : foyers, silex tailles, traces de torches
d'eclairage, amenagements de blocs rocheux, agencement de restes
faunistiques et, surtout, de tres nombreuses empreintes de cheminement
melees a celles des ours qui ont ete leurs contemporains dans les
galeries. On remarque egalement des points d'extraction du sediment :
confection de boulettes d'argile, recherche d'oxydes de fer et de
manganese pour la confection des peintures.

a ce jour, il parait que la grotte est le seul reseau orne totalement
intact qui nous soit parvenu depuis le Paleolithique.

Au plan de l'etude du milieu, la tres recente ouverture de la cavite
permettra d'en etudier la climatologie interne. Il convient aussi de
souligner la puissance des depots sedimentaires que la reprise
d'erosion posterieure a l'occupation humaine a permis de mettre
ponctuellement en evidence dans des puits de dissolution diriges vers
le reseau perenne toujours actif a ce jour. La carbonatation des
galeries est egalement intervenue apres le passage de l'Homme, scellant
en de nombreux points des artefacts dans la calcite.

Il existe la une occasion unique d'etude naturaliste visant a retracer
l'evolution des milieux naturels durant le dernier glaciaire et
l'Holocene.

C'est la convergence de l'ensemble de ces caracteres, deja
exceptionnels pour chacun d'entre eux, qui confere une importance
absolue au reseau nouvellement decouvert.

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
